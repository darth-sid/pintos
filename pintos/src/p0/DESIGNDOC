No

			     Kernel Monitor
			     ==============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----
>> C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.
For input, I wrote a readline function that accepts a buffer and uses input_getc
to monitor keyboard input and subsequently add the inputted char to the console
and passed-in buffer until '\n' or '\r' is read
For output, I just used printf for most of it and putchar in order to reflect
keyboard input to the console inside readline

>> C3: Any additional enhancement you implement?
Assuming it wasn't a requirement, readline rewinds the console output and buffer
when it receives a backspace
